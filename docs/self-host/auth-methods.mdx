title: "Auth methods"
---

Digger Community Edition supports 3 auth methods:
- JWT (via Frontegg)
- Basic HTTP
- No auth

# JWT auth
Auth via JWT token, same as used in Digger Cloud. As of Jan 2024 the only supported JWT auth provider is [Frontegg](https://docs.frontegg.com/docs/home-page). This is purely for historical reasons; please consider contributing by submitting a PR to address [this issue](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/issues/1074).

To configure JWT auth via Frontegg, set the following environment variables for Digger orchestrator backend:

- `JWT_AUTH=true`
- `AUTH_SECRET=<your Frontegg secret>`
- `FRONTEGG_CLIENT_ID=<your Frontegg client ID>`

# Basic HTTP auth
Handy for quick testing. Using basic auth in production scenarios is not recommended; consider using no-op auth behind an auth gateway instead.

To configure basic auth, set the following environment variables for Digger orchestrator backend:

- `HTTP_BASIC_AUTH=true`

# No-op auth
Handy for deploying Digger service behind a gateway that handles auth.

To configure no-op auth, set the following environment variables for Digger orchestrator backend:

- `NOOP_AUTH=true`
