# Does Digger support Terraform 1.6 and 1.7?

Digger does not officially support Terraform versions 1.6 and above (any version released after Hashicorp’s switch to BSL, [announced](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license) in August 2023). We recommend using [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) instead, a community fork of Terraform in response to Hashicorp’s license change. OpenTofu is [governed](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/announcing-opentofu) by Linux Foundation and [pending](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/81) CNCF sandbox.
